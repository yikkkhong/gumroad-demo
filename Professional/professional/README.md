Customization tips

- Hero text: update the headings and paragraph inside the `.hero` element in `index.html`.
- Showcase items: populate the grid statically in `index.html` or update `script.js` to fetch or generate items dynamically.
- Button placement: small visual offsets use `position: relative; top: Xpx;` in `.btn-primary` or adjust container spacing as needed.
- Modal content: edit the modal template in `index.html` and update `script.js` logic for dynamic population.
