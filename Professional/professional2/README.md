- `README.md`: This file.

**Quick Start**
- **Open locally**: Double-click `index.html` or open it in your browser.
- **Run a local server (recommended)**: From the project folder run one of the commands below, then open `http://localhost:8000`.

# If you have Python 3 installed
python -m http.server 8000

# Or, if your system uses python3 command
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
