**Overview:**
- **What it is:** A static web project containing `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates a minimal frontend layout with styles and client-side behavior suitable for learning or quick prototyping.

**Features:**
- **Static HTML:** Clean, semantic structure in `index.html`.
- **Responsive styles:** Basic layout and styles in `style.css`.
- **Client-side interactivity:** JavaScript behavior in `script.js`.

**Repository Structure:**
- **`index.html`:** Main page — entry point for the site.
- **`style.css`:** Styles for layout, typography, and responsive tweaks.
- **`script.js`:** Client-side JavaScript for interactivity.
- **`README.md`:** Project overview and instructions.

**Setup & Run (local):**
- **Open directly in browser:** Double-click `index.html` or open it from your browser (`File -> Open File...`). This works for simple static previews.
- **Serve with Python (recommended for local testing):**
	- Open a terminal in the project folder (the folder containing `index.html`).
	- Run:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

- **Serve with Node (if you prefer):**
	- If you have Node.js installed, run in the project folder:

```powershell
npx http-server . -p 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

**Development Notes:**
- **Edit HTML:** Modify `index.html` to change content or structure.
- **Edit CSS:** Update `style.css` for visual changes; consider adding CSS variables or frameworks as needed.
- **Edit JS:** Add or update behavior in `script.js`. Keep logic concise and separated from DOM markup.

**Contributing:**
