2. Ensure images are properly cropped before uploading
3. Use consistent dimensions for a professional look
4. Consider using WebP format for better compression (rename to .webp)

PLACEHOLDER IMAGES:

If you don't have images yet, you can use placeholder services:
- https://picsum.photos/800/1200 (random portrait images)
- https://placeholder.com/800x1200 (solid color placeholders)
- https://unsplash.com (free high-quality stock photos - use portrait orientation)

Simply download and rename them according to the naming convention above.
Remember to use PORTRAIT/VERTICAL orientation (taller than wide)!
