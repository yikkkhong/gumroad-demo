# Waterfall Portfolio - The Flow

A physics-based interactive portfolio template featuring a fluid particle simulation where water droplets interact with HTML content blocks.

### What You Can Do:
✅ Use the template for personal portfolio or client projects
✅ Modify and customize the template
✅ Create derivative works based on the template
✅ Use for commercial purposes (such as building a website for a client)

### What You Cannot Do:
❌ Resell or redistribute the template as-is
❌ Share the source code publicly
❌ Create competing products or templates using this source code
❌ Claim the template as your own creation
❌ Use without purchasing a license

## Features
 - **Physics-Based Particle System**: A custom canvas engine renders thousands of particles that simulate gravity, fluid dynamics, and collision.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Particles react to mouse movements and touch inputs, creating splashes and ripples as users interact with the page.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: HTML content blocks (.obs-collider) act as physical objects in the simulation. Water flows around them and bounces off their surfaces.

## Project Structure

- **index.html** – Main structure, text, navigation, layout  
- **style.css** – Styling, cursor, glassmorphism, spacing  
- **script.js** – Particle simulation, physics, collisions, mouse interactions

## How to Run

1. Download `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` into the same folder.  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
